# Global Ecological Footprint and Biocapacity

## Introduction

Ecological Footprint measures the ecological resources that a given population uses (demand side). 
Biocapacity represents an ecosystems capacity to provide natural resouces and absorb waste generated by humans(supply side). 
- In this study these measurement are tracked using six categories: Cropland, grazing land, fishing grounds, built-up land, forest area, and carbon demand on land.
- Both the Ecological Footprint and biocapacity are expressed in global hectaresâ€”globally comparable, standardized hectares with world average productivity.
- A region is considered ecologicaly decifit when the footprint exceeds it's biocapacity
- Its considered to have ecological reserve when it's biocapacity exceeds its footprint

### Motivating Questions 

* Which countries are Ecologically deficit?
* Which countries have ecological reserves?
* Is population growth correlated to a higher ecological footprint?
* How about the relationship between GDP per capita and the countries ecological footprint?

## Dataset 

I found the countries.csv data from Kaggle. The dataset was from 2016 and was updated 3 years ago  It was originally provided by the Global Footprint Network. The data uses six categories to track a country's Ecological footprint and biocapacity: cropland, grazing land, fishing grounds, built-up (or urban) land, forest area, and carbon demand on land.
