# Global Ecological Footprint and Biocapacity

## Introduction

Ecological Footprint measures the ecological resources that a given population uses (demand side).  Biocapacity represents an ecosystem’s capacity to provide natural resources and absorb waste generated by humans(supply-side). 
- They are measured by considering a region’s supply capacity and demand in these categories: croplands, grazing lands for animal products, forested areas to produce wood products, marine areas for fisheries, built-up land for housing and infrastructure, and forested land needed to absorb carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption.
- Both the Ecological Footprint and biocapacity are expressed in global hectares—globally comparable, standardized hectares with world average productivity.
- A region is considered ecologically deficit when the footprint exceeds its biocapacity (they relay on trade, or liquidate their resources i.e. overfishing).
- It’s considered to have an ecological reserve when it's biocapacity exceeds its footprint.

### Motivating Questions 

* Which countries are ecologically deficit?
* Which countries have ecological reserves?
* Is population growth correlated to a higher ecological footprint?
* How about the relationship between GDP per capita and the countries ecological footprint?



## Dataset 

I found the countries.csv data from Kaggle. The dataset was from 2016 and was updated 3 years ago.  It was originally provided by the Global Footprint Network. 

* sums five categories to track a country's ecological footprint: cropland footprint, grazing footprint, fish footprint, built-up (or urban) land, and carbon demand on land.
* sums five categories to track a country's biocapacity: cropland land, grazing land, fishing water, forest area, and urban land.
* the ecological footprint was subtracted from the biocapacity to determined if a country is ecologially deficit or has reserves. 
* 21 columns of data with a mixture of floats and strings
* 188 rows (188 countries)
* filling null values and conversion of column datatype was needed.
* I also deleted some countries with a lot of missing data. The final cleaned dataset contained 171 countries.

## Exploratory Data Aanlysis



### Biocapacity and Ecological Footprint by Country
For the heat maps to help visualizet the data better I eliminated three outliers. 






The heat map below represents the biocapacity of countries in my dataset. 



- It seems that South America has the hightest number of countries whose biocapacity is greater than its population’s Ecological Footprint. Let's look indepth at each of the categories by region.

####Observations 

- One reason Latine America has the greatest biocapacity of all the regions is due to it's large forest land. 

- The Europian region has the biggest ecologial footprint. 

- Countries in regions of Middle East/Central Asia, European Union, Northern/Easern Europe,European Union, Asian-Pacific have biocapacity have exceeded the regions biocapacity and are ecologically deficit.
